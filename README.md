# Heavy Traffic

A puzzle game made in under 48 hours using the mechanics of Astral Chain's "Heavy Traffic" puzzles.

The game was made with Svelte and it's the first program I've ever made using a front-end framework, so I know it's mostly anti-patterns.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## How to Play
